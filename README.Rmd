# Introduction

`gix` is an R package that aims to index and search a Git repository
using the [Xapian](http://xapian.org/) search engine.

## Index a repository

Index the content of a git repository to documents with the Xapian
search engine. A `document` is the data returned from a search. The
indexing creates a database located in the `.xapian` folder in the
repository.

```{r, index, message=FALSE}
library(gix)

## Index the 'gix' repository. (Current directory)
gixit(".", github = "stewid/gix")
```

## Search a repository

```{r, search_author, message=FALSE}
## Search for author Widgren and display url to blob on GitHub
gix(".", "author:widgren")$url
```

```{r, search_sha, message=FALSE}
## Search for sha that starts with 'd7'
gix(".", "sha:d7*")[, c("sha", "url")]
```

## Installation

The following two R packages must be installed:

 - [xapr](https://github.com/stewid/xapr)
 - [git2r](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r)

To install the development version of `gix`, it's easiest to use the
devtools package:

```{r, install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("stewid/gix")
```
Another alternative is to use `git` and `make`

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stewid/gix.git
$ cd gix
$ make install
```

**NOTE:** The package is in a very early development phase. Functions
and documentation may be incomplete and subject to
change. Suggestions, bugs, forks and pull requests are
appreciated. Get in touch.
